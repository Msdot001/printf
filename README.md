### Introduction
This project is part of the curriculum at ALX School of Software Engineering (ALX-SE). It aims to implement a simplified version of the printf function in C. The printf function is commonly used for formatted output in C programs, and this project provides an opportunity for students to understand its inner workings and practice their C programming skills.

### Project Overview
The "Printf Function" project is a team project developed by students in the ALX-SE program. The main goal is to create a functional printf function that can handle a subset of the format specifiers supported by the standard printf function in C. This project is intended for educational purposes, and it is not a replacement for the actual printf function provided by the C standard library.

### Team Members
This project was developed by a team of two students as part of their academic coursework at ALX School of Software Engineering:

[Moshood Owolabi] - GitHub: GitHub Profile
[Aderemi Aladeokin] - GitHub:GitHub Profile
[Houda Abdellaoui] - GitHub:GitHub Profile

### Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

src/ - This directory contains the source code for the printf function implementation.
include/ - Header files and any other include files necessary for the project.
tests/ - Unit tests and test cases to validate the functionality of the printf implementation.
main.c - A sample C program that demonstrates the usage of the printf function.

### How to Use
To use the printf function implemented in this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

/bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/printf-function.git

/bash
Copy code
./printf-test

You can now use the printf function in your C programs by including the relevant header files and calling the function.
